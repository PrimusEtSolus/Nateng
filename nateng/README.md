## 🎯 Project Overview

NatengHub is designed to address the challenges facing Benguet's agricultural sector by:

1. **Reducing Information Asymmetry**: Providing market intelligence and demand forecasting to farmers

3. **Enabling Multi-Actor Collaboration**: Facilitating a digital ecosystem connecting farmers, bulk buyers, and consumers
4. **Improving Farmer Income**: Reducing middleman layers and providing direct market access

### Key Objectives

- ✅ Identify information requirements for crop supply forecasting and delivery scheduling
- ✅ Determine architectural framework for multi-actor ecosystem
- ✅ Identify system features: crop programming dashboards, virtual trading, smart logistics
- ✅ Measure usability based on ISO 25010 software quality standards

For detailed information about the solution approach and research foundation, see [SOLUTION_OVERVIEW.md](./docs/SOLUTION_OVERVIEW.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture

NatengHub implements a **multi-actor ecosystem architecture** with the following components:

- **Consumers/Buyers**: Individual end-users purchasing products

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production-ready)
- **ORM**: Prisma 5.9.0
- **Components**: Radix UI

### Planned Integrations

- **Data Analytics**: Descriptive and predictive analytics for demand forecasting
- **Smart Logistics**: Hub-and-spoke order consolidation with truck ban compliance
- **Crop Programming**: Market intelligence dashboards for farmers

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

```

### Build & Test Status

✅ **Build Status**: `npm run build` passes successfully  
✅ **API Tests**: `node test-api-comprehensive.js` covers 12 endpoints with full CRUD verification  
✅ **BulkBuyer→Buyer Flow**: Complete - bulk buyers can add products via modal, buyers see listings immediately

### BulkBuyer→Buyer Path

The marketplace now supports the complete bulk buyer-to-buyer flow:

1. **Bulk Buyers** can add products via the "Add Product" modal in `/bulkBuyer/inventory`
2. **Products** appear immediately in the bulk buyer's inventory table
3. **Buyers** see bulk buyer listings on `/buyer/dashboard` (filtered to bulk buyer inventory only)
4. **Orders** flow from buyer cart → checkout → order confirmation → bulk buyer fulfillment

This creates a direct B2C channel where buyers purchase exclusively from bulk buyer listings.

### API Endpoints

- `GET/POST /api/products` - Product management
- `GET/POST /api/listings` - Listing management
- `GET/POST /api/orders` - Order management (requires Authorization header)
- `GET/POST /api/users` - User management
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/upload` - Image upload for products
- `GET/POST /api/messages` - User-to-user messaging
- `GET/PATCH /api/notifications` - Notification management
- `PATCH /api/users/[id]` - Update user (supports farmer settings fields)

For detailed API documentation, see [README_BACKEND.md](./README_BACKEND.md).

### Authentication & User Management

**Registration:**
- Users can register as: Farmer, Buyer, or Bulk Buyer
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Email uniqueness enforced

**Login:**
- Secure password authentication
- Session management via localStorage (upgradeable to JWT)
- Automatic role-based dashboard redirection

**Seed Data:**
- Running `npm run seed` creates sample users, products, and listings for testing
- Users can register new accounts through the signup pages

For complete implementation details, see [FULLSTACK_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./FULLSTACK_IMPLEMENTATION.md).
